Now we've completed the **starter project** from the Next.js documentations.

The lessons have covered:

- What is Next.js
- Navigation (a.k.a routing)
- Managing assets, metadata and css stylesheets
- Rendering methods and data fetching
  - SSG (Static Generation)
  - SSR (Server-side Rendering)
  - CSR (Client-side Rendering)
- API Routes
- Deployment via Vercel


Now we got to a point. I'll start the project that is in my mind and believe me it's fascinating. You'll see how I quickly adapt Next.js and develop a fully-fledged app with it.
